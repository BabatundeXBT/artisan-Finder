## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm gold (#FFD700) to evoke feelings of quality, tradition, and skilled craftsmanship. It's welcoming but also implies expertise.
- Background color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC), a gentle background color that evokes both reliability and approachability; desaturated enough not to compete with the other elements on the screen.
- Accent color: Deep orange (#FF8C00). This is more saturated and vibrant than the primary, offering excellent contrast that makes it well-suited to call-to-action buttons.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern humanist sans-serif suited for all body text, particularly the longer blocks of text that may appear in profiles or reviews.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif similar to Didot, lending an elegant feel to titles. Pairing well with PT Sans.
- Use clear, outlined icons to represent artisan categories (e.g., a wrench for plumbers, scissors for tailors).
- Clean and intuitive layout with a prominent search bar on the home page. Consistent design across all pages.
